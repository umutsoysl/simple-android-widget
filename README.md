# simple-android-widget
This is a sample Android Studio project that shows the necessary code to create a widget

### Description
This is a sample Android Studio project with nothing except a widget, so you can use it to implement widgets in your own app. Once installed in the device (no app will show up), go to the widgets menu to add the new widget to the home screen.

### Usage
Just have a look at the code, or better still, clone it to a local repository in your machine:

git clone
```
https://github.com/umutsoysl/simple-android-widget.git
```
and open it in Android Studio. Feel free to create pull requests to improve the implementation or documentation so it will help others. 

Give me a star if you find it useful! Another great milestone in my Simple series. Enjoy!
